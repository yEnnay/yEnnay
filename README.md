## Hi, I'm Richel 👋

💻 **Not a hardcore coder — I code responsibly.**
*(By responsibly, I mean I Google first and panic later.)*

### 👩‍💻 About Me

* 🧩 I build **web-based systems** that work… after a few refreshes
* 🌱 Learning **PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and security basics** — bugs are my teachers
* 🤝 Open to **collabs, academic projects, and friendly dev struggles**
* 🧠 I enjoy clean logic, readable code, and documentation that saves future-me

### 🛠️ Tech I Use

`HTML` • `CSS` • `JavaScript` • `PHP` • `MySQL`

### ✨ Very Fun, Very True Facts

* ⚡ Not a hard coder, just **hardworking enough to deploy, demo, and survive thesis defense**
* 🐛 If it works, I wrote it. If it breaks, it was *experimental*.

📌 *Building systems. Learning daily. Pretending everything is under control.* 😄
